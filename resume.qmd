# Professional Summary

Motivated and versatile digital marketing professional with a strong foundation in media planning, branded content, and campaign strategy. My early career included roles at industry leaders like Universal Music Group, Universal McCann, and Studio71, where I managed digital campaigns for top-tier clients including Sony, Taco Bell, and Taylor Swift. I’ve led cross-functional teams, built branded entertainment proposals, and optimized performance using analytics across streaming, social, and email platforms.

After several formative years in the entertainment industry, I took a personal leap to pursue acting full-time in Los Angeles—joining the Screen Actor’s Guild and appearing in episodes of *Insecure* on HBO. During this chapter, I supported myself as a substitute teacher with LAUSD and worked in hospitality, honing adaptability, empathy, and communication skills. Feel free to ask me about it. It's quite a story...

Recognizing the rapid evolution of the digital landscape, I chose to return to school full-time to earn a Master of Science in Digital Marketing at Cal Poly Pomona (graduating August 2025). This program is allowing me to update my skill set with cutting-edge training in SEO, analytics, and performance marketing strategies.

With both agency and entertainment industry experience, and renewed technical expertise, I bring a well-rounded, modern approach to digital marketing—ready to make an impact in today’s data-driven landscape.
