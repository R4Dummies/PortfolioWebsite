I’m a digital marketing professional with a strong foundation in media planning, branded content, and digital promotions. I’ve launched campaigns for brands like Sony Pictures and Universal Music Group, and collaborated on branded entertainment with top-tier clients across the entertainment and consumer sectors. Currently earning my M.S. in Digital Marketing at Cal Poly Pomona—where I was named the MSDM “Student of the Year” for the Class of 2025 and inducted into the Beta Gamma Sigma Honors Society—I bring a data-informed approach to strategy, content, and audience engagement. My diverse background—including education and customer service—has sharpened my communication skills and adaptability, allowing me to thrive in fast-paced, cross-functional environments.
